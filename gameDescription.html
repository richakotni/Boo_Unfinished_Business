	Boo’s Unfinished Business is an engaging character-switch parody of the Mario games.
	Boo, a villainous ghost from the Mario series, is the cute and friendly central 
	character of Unfinished Business and the player must navigate Boo through
	three rooms/levels of a haunted house. The objective of the game is to make Boo 
	move through all the rooms, collect coins and avoid adversaries. 
	This game is a twist on archetypes of Mario characters in that Boo is the 
	protagonist and Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Luma are antagonists. Meet the 
	characters of our game. From Left to right, Boo, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Luma.

	Meet the characters of our game. From Left to right, ... Boo, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Luma.

<H1 id="gameplan">Rules of the game</H1>

<P> 
	The haunted house has three rooms: the library, dining room, and bedroom. 
	The game begins with Boo in the bottom left corner of the library and his objective 
	is to make it through the library to the dining room from where Boo must reach 
	and exit the bedroom, all while trying to collect the most coins and avoiding 
	the lumas. In each room, the player has to navigate Boo using the four cursor 
	keys (up, down, left, and right). 

</P>
<P>	
	Boo is given three lives to start with, displayed by three red hearts at the top 
	left corner of the pane. If any of the adversary (Luma, Peach, Luigi, or Mario) 
	touches Boo, Boo loses one life, indicated by one of the hearts disappearing and 
	leaving a faint red outline in its wake. The game is over if Boo runs out of lives. 
	However, Boo can regain a life by collecting 5 coins and those 5 coins are deducted 
	from the total number of coins. Boo can never have more than three lives. 
</P>
<P>	
	Once Boo collects all coins in a room, Boo can proceed to next room. 
	Each room/level has two doors, either on the left or the right wall of the room. 
	One of the doors leads to the next room (or the end of the game if it’s the last room).
	The other door leads to a dark room known as the fight room. 

</P>	
<P>
	The fight rooms poses as an additional challenge to Boo. 
	In each fight room, one adversary meets Boo. Each fight room gets
	progressively more difficult. In the first fight room from the library, 
	Peach roams around randomly and all Boo needs to do is to avoid contact with her 
	and collect all the coins. In the second fight room from the dining room, 
	Luigi also moves randomly but now even lumas are present in the room.
	In the third fight room from the attic, Mario roams around and chases Boo 
	at a fast pace as soon as Boo enters the room.
</P>

<P>
	If Boo exits the Attic, the last room/level, and collects all the coins, 
	the game ends and the player wins.
